### Option 1: Pre-compiled executable
1. Download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/seregonwar/DiscordServerCloner/releases) section  
2. Extract the ZIP file  
3. Run `Discord Server Cloner.exe`  

### Option 2: From source code
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/seregonwar/DiscordServerCloner.git
   cd DiscordServerCloner
   ```


2. Install dependencies:

## How to use

1. Start the application
2. Enter your Discord token and click on “verify”
3. Search the list for the server you want to clone (based on the server ID, not just the name).
4. Enter the destination server ID (must be an empty server)
5. Select the elements you want to clone (roles, channels, etc.)
6. Click on **Start Cloning**
7. Wait for the process to complete
8. For security reasons, be sure to log out once you have completed the cloning process in order to invalidate your token and render it unusable! Anyone who comes into possession of your still-valid token could have full access to it, and you would never know!

## Building the executable

To create a standalone executable:

1. Make sure you have PyInstaller installed:

   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
2. Run the build script:

   ```bash
   python build.py
   ```
3. The executable file will be created in the `dist` folder and a ZIP archive containing the distribution will be created in the main directory.

## Troubleshooting

* **Authentication error**: Verify that the Discord token is valid and has the necessary permissions
* **Cloning error**: Make sure the source and destination servers exist and that you have the necessary permissions for both
* **"Same server" error**: The source and destination server IDs cannot be the same
